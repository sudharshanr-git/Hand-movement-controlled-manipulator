# Hand-movement-controlled-manipulator
Program for a robotic manipulator that can be controlled by hand movements

Uses Arduino as microcontroller. 3 servo motors as joints. Python for hand detection.

This control of manipulators using hand provides better precission in work and easier than using remotes.
